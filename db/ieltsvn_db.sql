(3, 'Farming without big machines is hard work. Planting and fertilizing alone can take days in the hot sun. Researchers are working to develop simple machines to make life easier for farmers in the developing world. They would also like to help the farmers save money. Jelle Van Loon is testing a model of a hand-held planting tool designed for small-scale farmers. It is a long metal hoe with just two flat teeth. With each stroke one tooth plants a seed; the other adds a little fertilizer. Jelle Van Loon is not a farmer. He is an engineer at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. Mr. Van Loon is working to develop low cost tools for small scale farmers around the world. He hopes the tools will save them work, time and money. Usually he starts with a piece of equipment built somewhere else. An example is a hand-planter from Brazil. The long, wooden V-shaped tool has a piece of metal on the bottom for breaking up the soil. Opening the arms of a part shaped like the letter V loads seed and fertilizer into the metal tip. This tool is faster and costs less than planting by hand. It uses less seed and fertilizer. It can also reduce by half the time required for planting and fertilizing a two-hectare farm. The planter still costs about $200 to make. Jelle Van Loon thinks the final product will cost less. However, he says, more work is needed. His team is now testing their fourth version of the planter. Mr. Van Loon says the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center will publish plans for the tool on the Internet after the group has finished its work.', 'media/2015/12/1451025665-1.

(5, 'High-tech companies are developing the next generation of products that will help us drive cars, do our shopping and even care for our children. The technology company Intel recently held a demonstration of some of its new devices in San Francisco. One device measured how alert a driver was. Sensors connected to the driver''s head measured brain activity. Cameras placed on the car''s dashboard measured eye movement. Justin Rattner works at Intel Labs. He says the devices measure how much of the brain is occupied while the person is driving. Devices like these, he says, will make driving safer. Another experimental Intel technology links cars electronically to help prevent crashes. When the driver of the car in front signals a turn or slows down, an alert message is sent to the car in back. There was also a demonstration of a virtual computer. The computer was projected onto the table from a controller hidden in a flower pot. Sensors read the movements of the users'' hands, so there was no need for a mouse or other handheld device. This technology could be used in everyday situations. At a market, sensors and computer chips placed in products could help shoppers find the items they want to buy. For example, the technology could help them avoid foods that could cause an allergic reaction. Cameras and sensors are already available to help parents watch their children. In the future, other equipment will monitor a baby''s health and mood. And security systems are being improved and simplified, with face-recognition software instead of complicated passwords.', 'media/2015/12/1451019769-2.

(6, 'A top health expert warns that the world needs to deal with what he calls the â€œfirst Ebola epidemic the world has known.â€ Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control spoke to reporters at the C.D.C. headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. He warned that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa could spread widely. He said a huge global effort is needed to contain the disease. Dr. Frieden just returned from a visit to the most affected countries: Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. He said Ebola cases continue to increase quickly even though health care workers are working extremely hard against the spread. News reports say the number of cases is more than 5,000. Dr. Frieden warned that there is a window of opportunity to stop Ebola. But he added that window is closing. The C.D.C. chief said the Ebola virus is spreading in two ways: from patients to care givers and through unsafe treatment of the dead. Dr. Frieden warned that each dayâ€™s delay in dealing with the Ebola spread makes it more difficult to stop. The C.D.C. director said resources, technical experts and a worldwide, organized and unified plan are needed. He said Ebola is not only an African problem, but a world problem. U.S. health officials have announced an agreement with a California-based drugmaker, Mapp Biopharmaceuticals. The deal calls for the company to speed development of the experimental Ebola medicine ZMapp. ZMapp has not been tested on humans. But, two American medical missionaries who had Ebola were treated with the drug and recovered.\r\n', 'media/2015/12/1451383808-3.

(7, 'Today we hear expert suggestions for academic writing. Jennifer Ahern-Dodson is an assistant professor of the Practice in Writing Studies at Duke University in North Carolina. Ms. Ahern-Dodson likes to start a conversation with both students and professors planning to write a paper or essay. She asks about their earlier writing experiences. Were they negative or positive? She says you are not alone if you have had problems with your writing. Everyone struggles with writing. â€œWriting is hard. Itâ€™s hard for all writers at some pointâ€, she says. â€œAnd at some point you are going to hit a roadblockâ€, she adds. She advises to think about earlier experiences. When the writing is going well, what was happening? When the writing was not going well, what was happening? She says most peopleâ€™s negative writing experiences happened because a very specific formula or page limit was required.

(8, 'A new report says China''s demand for food imports will sharply rise in the next 10 years. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development made the prediction. They say China will increase its imports of grains, oil seeds and meat. Angel Gurria is secretary-general of the OECD. He says China''s need for food is growing at a time when world food production is decreasing. Imports to China are expected to grow at a yearly rate of three percent to 1.7 million tons by the year 2022. China''s imports of crops used to feed animals, called coarse grains, are expected to double by 2022. And imports of oil seeds are predicted to rise 41 percent. Angel Gurria says China''s economic growth is fueling its hunger for imports. He says the country already has a big effect on world food markets. Jose Graziano Da Silva is the head of the Food and Agriculture Organization. He says reducing the large amount of food that is now wasted would help meet the growing demand for food. The rise in the Chinese demand for food is expected to cause grain and other commodity prices to rise. Businesses are taking new steps because of China''s influence on world food trade. Last month, the Chinese meat processing company Shuanghui announced a $7 billion offer for the American pork company Smithfield Foods. China is already the world''s biggest importer of milk and soybeans. It is expected to become the world''s biggest consumer of pork, passing the European Union within 10 years.

All we know is that people have been growing chilies for centuries. And there are plenty of different kinds of chili peppers to choose from. Want to spice up your meals with homegrown chilies? They need a warm climate. If you plant the seeds outside when the weather is cool, place a glass over them. That will add warmth from the sun and protect them from wind. You can also start the seeds in your home or a greenhouse. If you plant chili peppers inside, fill an eight-centimeter pot with soil. The pot should have holes on the bottom so water can run out. Drop seeds over the surface of the container and cover with a thin layer of vermiculite. Vermiculite is a material that can hold air, water and nutrients. Then cover the top of the pot with a see-through plastic bag. Hold the bag in place with a rubber band. Place the pot in a warm area. You should take off the bag when the chilies start growing. When the plants have reached about two centimeters high, place each one in its own pot. When the roots show through the holes on the bottom of the pot, transplant each seedling into a 12 centimeter pot. When the plants are 20 centimeters high, tie the plants to a stick placed in the pot to support them. When the chili peppers are 30 centimeters high, pull off the tops with your fingers.

Children can learn how to manage money, especially at an early age, when financial mistakes are not very costly. The amount of money that parents give to their children to spend as they wish differs from family to family. Timing is another consideration. Some children get a weekly allowance. Others get a monthly allowance. Parents should make clear what, if anything, the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Older children may be responsible enough to save money for larger costs, like clothing or electronics. Many people who have written on the subject of allowances say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the house, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want.

(20, 'I have a question for you: When is a plant considered a weed? Well, the experts at Penn State University have a simple answer: When the bad qualities outweigh the good qualities. Consider the fact that crops produce several hundred seeds from each plant. By comparison, each weed plant can produce tens or even hundreds of thousands of seeds. And some buried seeds can survive up to 40 years or longer. Eradicating, or getting rid of, weeds means that you have to remove all the seeds and roots so the plants will not grow back. But birds, wind and weather can bring them back to the land. A more common way to deal with weeds is to control them so that the land can be used for planting. Experts advise using two or more control methods. Chemical weed killers or natural treatments like corn gluten can suppress weed growth. Dense planting of a crop can also act as a natural control. Bill Curran is a professor of weed science at Penn State University in Pennsylvania. He says one of the most common methods for suppressing weeds is dense planting. He says a dense, competitive crop that quickly shades the soil will help. The weeds need light to grow, so blocking the sun will reduce their growth. Other controls include turning over the soil, pulling the weeds or covering them with mulch made of shredded wood, garden waste or other material. But even mulch has its limits. Weeds can be transported in mulch. This is also true of soil, grain, hay and animals. Animals like sheep or goats eat weeds, so they can provide a biological control. Even insects and other organisms can also act as biological controls.', 'media/2015/12/1451497369-16. What Makes a Plant a Weed.mp3', '2015-12-31 00:42:51'),

(30, 'Each year, bad food sickens about one in six Americans. But, proposed new rules raise hopes to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than 1 million cases of food-related illnesses each year. The new rules were proposed recently, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting that law into effect. They represent the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s. The new law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing foodborne illnesses. Experts say this is a change in the way that the FDA has dealt with disease outbreaks in the past. Congress passed the law after a series of outbreaks that were linked to spinach, peanut butter and other foods. The agency is proposing to require food manufacturers to show that they have identified where contamination is most likely to happen. Manufacturers would also have to show that they have taken steps to prevent problems. The proposed rules also deal with safety in growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that establishing all of the provisions of the law will cost the government $1.4 billion. The Grocery Manufacturers of America, an industry group, has not released an estimate of what it will cost producers. But FDA Deputy Commissioner Michael Taylor says the new rules are worth the cost. He says there should be reductions in illness and disruptions in the food supply, and increases in buyer confidence. He says, when these issues are considered, the benefits outweigh the costs of the new law.', 'media/2015/12/1451497667-26. New Rules Aim to Improve Food Safety in US.mp3', '2015-12-31 00:47:51'),

Companies at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas talked about new developments, like touch computers, or laptops that turn into tablets. The chip manufacturer Intel made a surprise announcement at the show. Mike Fard says his company is taking steps to reduce power requirements on some processors. He says Intel is constantly trying to provide more battery life. Yet sales of PCs are slow. Research company IDC reported that worldwide sales of PCs dropped 14 percent in the first three months of 2013. The company said this was the worst drop since it started collecting information in 1994. One possible reason for the slow sales is the rise of tablet computers, such as Apple''s iPad. Intel and its competitors have sought to improve sales by offering new products. These include the ultrabook, a thin, lightweight notebook computer, which came out in 2011. But they have not lifted sales. Industry experts are also concerned about reaction to Microsoft''s Windows 8 operating system. It was released last October. Bob O''Donnell, an IDC vice president, said the Windows 8 launch not only failed to increase PC sales, but seemed to have slowed the market. He has criticized the company for making &quot;radical changes,&quot; such as removing the &quot;start&quot; button from the operating system.

Most of the studies were less than 10 years old. They included almost 3 million adults from around the world, including the United States, Canada, China, Taiwan, Brazil, India and Mexico. The researcher was carried out at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. The study found that people who are considered overweight or slightly obese were five to six percent less likely to die from all causes than people of normal weight. But, people with higher obesity ratings had almost a 30 percent greater risk of death compared to normal-weight individuals. Katherine Flegal led the study. She says she was not surprised that there was no higher risk for overweight people. But she had not thought that the risk of death was definitely lower. The study has raised new questions about &quot;body mass index,&quot; or BMI. This is a measurement of body fat as a ratio of height to weight. BMI guidelines were used for the study. In recent years, many public health experts have promoted body mass index as a way to predict the risk of health problems. But a person''s BMI can be misleading.

(35, 'Companion planting is the idea that some kinds of plants can help each other grow. Plants that are compatible together generally have similar needs in terms of nutrients, soil and moisture levels. Advice about which plants are compatible is sometimes based more on tradition than proof. But experts say there is evidence to support certain combinations. These can improve harvests, reduce disease and help with pest control by attracting helpful insects. For example, some kinds of soil bacteria take nitrogen from the air and make it into a form that plants can use. The plants hold the nitrogen in their roots. Legumes are especially good at this nitrogen-fixing. Then any crops that share the same space as the legumes can get the nitrogen as the roots decompose. Beans and potatoes can also share territory well because their roots reach different levels in the soil. Deep-rooted vegetables get nutrients and moisture from lower down in the soil, so they do not compete with plants with shallower roots. But some plants placed together may harm each other''s development. For example, tomatoes do not like wet soil but watercress does, so you would probably want to keep them separated. Some kinds of produce should be kept apart even after being harvested. This is because of ethylene gas. Ethylene is a plant hormone that can cause some foods to ripen too quickly. Apples release ethylene gas. Apricots, melons and tomatoes also release a lot of ethylene. Some vegetables are easily affected by ethylene, including asparagus, broccoli, cabbage and cucumbers. This risk of ripening too soon is why markets often separate high ethylene-producing foods from those that are sensitive to the gas. But if you put an apple in a bag with a green banana, the ethylene from the apple will make the banana ready to eat sooner. What about peaches, plums and nectarines that are too firm to eat? These kinds of fruit do not need any help from an apple -- they release enough ethylene to ripen themselves. But that does not mean there is no way to get the job done faster. Growers suggest placing the fruit in a fruit bowl or in a paper bag with the top folded over. Keep the fruit at room temperature, out of direct sunlight. Once the fruit is soft enough to your liking, it should either be used or refrigerated to keep it from getting too ripe. Yuck.', 'media/2015/12/1451497781-31.

That was the finding of a new study that should be satisfying to anyone who counts calories for weight control. More than one billion adults are overweight. The World Health Organization calls obesity a global epidemic. Government researchers have just reported their latest estimates for the United States. The good news: obesity rates have not increased much in recent years. The bad news: they have not decreased either. More than one-third of adults were obese in two thousand nine and two thousand ten. Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows there are all kinds of conflicting diet plans. Some tell people not to eat carbohydrates. Others say not to eat fats. Still others say to eat more protein. Or to eat less protein. Dr. George Bray at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana led the new study. He wanted to know if protein affects weight gain. Twenty-five healthy adults were in the study. They were overfed by almost a thousand calories a day over an eight-week period. Calories in food are a measure of energy. The people followed diets with low, normal or high levels of protein. Normal was defined as fifteen percent of energy from protein. Dr. Bray says all of them gained weight: &quot;Fat storage was exactly the same with all three levels of protein. It was the calories that they ate that affected the body fat that they stored.&quot; Those who ate a higher percentage of protein gained more lean body mass. Dr. Bray says the opposite happened on a low protein diet: &quot;If your protein intake''s low, you''ll actually lose body mass even though you''re eating an excess amount of calories.&quot;He tells his patients to weigh themselves regularly so they can know quickly if they gain weight. His study appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian at the Harvard School of Public Health studies the relationship between diet and conditions like heart disease and diabetes.

The children whose teachers most often discussed the print showed clearly higher skills in reading, spelling and understanding. These results were found one year and even two years later. Shayne Piasta at Ohio State University was an author of the study. She said most preschool teachers would find this method manageable and would need only a small change in the way they teach. They already read storybooks in class. The only difference would be increased attention to the printed text. If you get children to pay attention to letters and words, it makes sense they would do better at word recognition and spelling. But research suggests that very few parents and teachers do this in a systematic way. The report appeared in the journal Child Development. More than 300 children ages four and five were observed for the study. The children came from poor families and were below average in their language skills.

People like that are often said to spend money &quot;like a drunken sailor&quot; or &quot;like there''s no tomorrow.&quot; In the United States, people who want to start a savings account have different choices of where to put their money. These include banks and credit unions. Credit unions are cooperatives for people who have some kind of connection. For example, the members might work for a university or a government agency. Most credit unions are nonprofit organizations. Credit unions, banks and other financial institutions pay interest on savings accounts. But the interest rates are low. Certificates of deposit pay higher returns. With a certificate of deposit, or CD, a person agrees not to withdraw the money for a certain period of time. This term could be anywhere from a few months to several years. Longer terms, and larger amounts, pay higher interest. People can withdraw their money early but they have to pay a penalty. Another way to save is through a money market fund. This is a kind of mutual fund. Mutual funds invest money from many people. The money is sometimes placed in short-term government securities. Money market funds, however, may not be federally guaranteed like other kinds of savings. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees savings up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars. In a number of countries, people have been saving less over the years. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is a group of thirty-four countries.

The larva digs into the cricket and eats the insect from the inside out. The yellow fly is native to Central America and the southern United States. It finds its larva host by listening for the cricketâ€™s sound. The flyâ€™s strong sense of hearing can direct it to a cricket even 100 meters away. But the insectâ€™s ears are just two millimeters apart. That is so close that sound should reach each ear at almost the same moment. This would make it difficult to find where a sound came from.

They had an argument because Annie didn''t want to talk to Hector and Hector didn''t know the reason why. Meanwhile, Bridget was back with a paper bag over her head. Annie persuaded her to drop it off revealing the double coloured hairstyle which made Bridget was so embarrassed and the others burst into laughing. Miguel was finally there and surprisingly he had the same hairstyle with Bridget. The red and yellow hair duo were so pleased to see each other.
